# Turtle => Mutant Rainbow
 - I have made a program where turtle moves across the screen rapidly while changing color, leaving a line behind it
 - the program asks you how thick and long you want each of the strokes and draws accordingly
 - I made this program with the help of the book Coding Projects in Python, a book by DK : https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Projects-Python-DK/dp/1465461884
 - If you would like to add or change anything in this program, it would be great if you could tell me what you changed.
